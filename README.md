### 🕹️ My Coding Journey

I started my coding journey all the way back in 1999 and made my first simple web sites related to my first car - a 1978 Ford Escort RS2000 Replica. After a few years, and several homepage projects, I decided to learn how to actually build web pages with HTML and CSS. This lead tot he creation of a discussion board called EscortPower.net. This website was quite popular in the Ford Escort community at the time and had good number of daily users. I developed this site from 2002 to 2004 when it was sold to a automotive decal sticker company that wanted to integrate their business into the site.

After I sold the web site, real-life took over and I fell out of the web development game for quite a number of years. I dabbled a bit with various CMS discussion board sites and also made an effort to learn PHP. This was when PHP was in version 3, and I have long since forgot most of what I learned then.

In march of 2024 I decided to put all my time and effort into becoming a professional web developer and eventually make the switch from my current day job (CNC Programmer/Operator) to making a living out of what I truly have a passion for. I am still kicking my 20-year-old self for not getting into computer science at college when I had the chance, but I did not have the right mindset at the time.

I am fully aware that the self-taught web developer route is a difficult one, and I do not expect this to be a walk in the park. However I am prepared to do whatever it takes to make this dream a reality.
