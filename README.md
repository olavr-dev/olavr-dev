### `💻 Web Developer` `🧑🏻‍💻 Programmer` `🤓 Nerd` `🕹️ Gamer`

I am a web developer and programmer from Norway. I am really passionate about computers, programming, web development, and everything else related to it. It is immensely satisfying to write a line or two of code and figuring out what all the `0`'s and `1`'s of a computer actually do.

On this page you get to join me on my quest to solve whatever real-life problems I encounter using code.

```python
# Lets get coding!
print("Hello, world!")
```

## 🗺️ My Web Developer Roadmap

### ⚡ **_This is how I plan to do my web developer journey_** ⚡

**Step 1** 🧑🏻‍💻 `in progress` **[100 Days of Code - 2024 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code-web-development-bootcamp/)** _by Academind_

**Step 2** 🧑🏻‍💻 **[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)** - Learning more web development. More learning by doing on my own.

- **JavaScript** track first
- **Ruby** track second

**Step 3** 🧑🏻‍💻 **[FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn)** - Basically just using FreeCodeCamp to make additional projects after Odin Project.

**_Complete the FreeCodeCamp's core curriculum certifications:_**

- **[Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/) Certification**
- **[JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/) Certification**
- **[Front End Development Libraries](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/) Certification**

## 🕹️ My Coding Journey

I started my coding journey all the way back in 1999 and made my first simple web sites related to my first car - a 1978 Ford Escort RS2000 Replica. After a few years, and several homepage projects, I decided to learn how to actually build web pages with HTML and CSS. This lead tot he creation of a discussion board called EscortPower.net. This website was quite popular in the Ford Escort community at the time and had good number of daily users. I developed this site from 2002 to 2004 when it was sold to a automotive decal sticker company that wanted to integrate their business into the site.

After I sold the web site, real-life took over and I fell out of the web development game for quite a number of years. I dabbled a bit with various CMS discussion board sites and also made an effort to learn PHP. This was when PHP was in version 3, and I have long since forgot most of what I learned then.
